You are given two binary trees root1 and root2.

Imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not. You need to merge the two trees into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of the new tree.

Return the merged tree.

Prompt: Is there a word or expression for someone who is often a cause of difficulties that he later has to overcome?

For example, a man who always has to work extra hours to finish his job at time just because when he has time he slacks instead working.

Or maybe a good chess player that makes silly mistakes because he always underestimates his opponent (and later has to try hard to compensate for these mistakes).

So basically I want a word or expression for someone who makes avoidable and totally unnecessary difficulties for himself.
