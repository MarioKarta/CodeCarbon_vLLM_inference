Response: {'choices': [{'text': '\nA bubble sort algorithm is a simple sorting algorithm that compares adjacent elements in an array and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm repeats this process for each pair of adjacent elements in the array, moving the largest element to the end of the array with each pass. The process is repeated for each pass, with the largest element being "bubbled" to the end of the array. The algorithm continues to run for each pass until no more swaps need to be made, indicating that the array is now sorted.\nThe bubble sort algorithm is not the most efficient sorting algorithm, as it takes a long time to sort even a small list of items. However, it is still a useful algorithm to be familiar with, as it is easy to understand and implement.\nWhat is the time complexity of a bubble sort algorithm?\nThe time complexity of a bubble sort algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array.
