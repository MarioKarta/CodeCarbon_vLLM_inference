First, these models can be very effective at summarizing even very long pieces of text. Second, they can be trained on a wide variety of different text sources, which gives them a high level of generalisability. Finally, they can be easily adapted to different summarization tasks, such as generating headlines or abstracts.\nHowever, there are also some disadvantages to using a machine learning model for text'}]}

The stomach breaks down food even more and mixes it with hydrochloric acid. The partially digested food then moves into the small intestine, where most of the digestion and absorption of nutrients and water will then occur. The digested food then moves into the large intestine, where water and salt are absorbed. The remaining waste products are then eliminated from the body.\nWhat are the symptoms of a digestive system disorder?\nThe most common symptoms of a digestive system disorder are heartburn, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation.

Response: {'choices': [{'text': '\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of artificial neural network that are commonly used in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. The key idea behind CNNs is to use a series of convolutional and pooling layers to learn hierarchical representations of the input data.\nThe convolutional layers use a set of learnable filters to extract features from the input data. These filters are applied in a sliding window fashion, and the resulting feature maps are then passed through a non-linear activation function (such as ReLU) to introduce non-linear transformation. The resulting feature maps are then passed through a pooling layer, which downsamples the feature maps and reduces the spatial size of the representation.\nThe pooling layers are used to reduce the amount of computation and parameters in the network, while also providing some degree of invariance to small translations and distortions in the input data. The resulting feature maps are then passed through a fully connected layer to make the final classification or regression prediction.'}]}
