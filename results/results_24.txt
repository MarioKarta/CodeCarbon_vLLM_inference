Response: {'choices': [{'text': ' (5 marks)\nGenetic engineering is the process of altering the genetic makeup of an organism. This is done by inserting a gene from one organism into another organism. This can be done to improve crop yields. For example, a gene that makes a plant resistant to a certain disease can be inserted into a crop plant. This will make the crop plant more resistant to that disease, and therefore more likely to survive and produce a higher yield.\nGenetic engineering can also be used to improve the nutritional content of crops. For example, a gene that makes a plant produce more protein can be inserted into a crop plant. This will make the crop plant more nutritious, and therefore more likely to be consumed by humans and animals.\nGenetic engineering can also be used to improve the quality of crops.
