Response: {'choices': [{'text': " Explain your answer.\nNewton's third law of motion states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that when one object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first object. This law is important in understanding how objects interact with each other and how forces are transmitted through a system.\nOne example of Newton's third law of motion is when a person pushes against a wall. The person exerts a force on the wall, and the wall exerts an equal and opposite force on the person. This force is what causes the person to move away from the wall. Another example is when a car accelerates forward. The car's engine exerts a force on the car, and the car exerts an equal and opposite force on the engine. This force is what causes the car to move forward.\nNewton's third law of motion is also important in understanding how objects interact with each other in a system. For example,"}]}
