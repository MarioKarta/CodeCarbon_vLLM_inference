Response: {'choices': [{'text': '\n\nA language model is a statistical model that predicts the probability of a sequence of words given some context. The maximum input size for a language model depends on the model architecture and the hardware being used.\n\nFor example, a language model based on LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) can have a maximum input size of around 1000 words. This is because LSTMs have a hidden state that can store a fixed-size vector of values, and the size of this vector is typically around 1000.\n\nHowever, a language model based on LSTMs can be parallelized such that multiple time steps can be processed in parallel. This allows for a much larger input size to be processed. For example, a language model based on LSTMs can be parallelized such that 10,000 time steps can be processed in parallel.\n\nIn conclusion, the maximum input size for a language model depends on the model'}]}

Prompt: Given the string numbertext, which is a number in letters, you need to output the corresponding integer. For this, the counting system is revised: numbers 1 through 999 are all expressed in combinations of the basic strings one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine and the higher values ten and hundred.

For 1 through 9, everything is normal. However: 10 through 999 are written only with combinations of the above strings, space-separated. Some examples:
10, 11, 12, etcetera: one ten, one ten one, one ten two, etcetera.
20, 30, ..., 90: two ten, three ten, ..., nine ten.
21, 31, ..., 91: two ten one, three ten one, ..., nine ten one.
100 is one hundred, 305 is three hundred five, 425 is four hundred two ten five, and 999 is nine hundred nine ten nine.

Based on the given numbertext, you need to output the corresponding integer. For example, with input eight hundred two ten five you have to output 825.

Founded in the 13th century, Berlin has had an eventful history. Excavations from 2008 suggest that the city may be even older than was previously assumed: state archaeologists have discovered an oak beam that probably dates back to 1183.

Almost no other metropolis has experienced such frequent, radical change transforming the face of the city. Although Berlin saw steady growth in its importance, dazzling epochs alternated with darker eras. Nevertheless, the formerly divided city has succeeded in becoming a vibrant metropolis in the heart of Europe.
