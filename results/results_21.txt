Response: {'choices': [{'text': '\nIn: ELI5: the concept of gravitational waves and their importance in astrophysics.\nGravitational waves are ripples in the curvature of space-time that are generated by the accelerated motion of massive bodies.

For example, we can now observe the merger of black holes and neutron stars, the collapse of massive stars, and the birth of the first black holes.\nGravitational waves carry information about the properties of the sources that emit them, such as their masses, spins, and charges.

Prompt: We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

-1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).

Return the number that I picked.
