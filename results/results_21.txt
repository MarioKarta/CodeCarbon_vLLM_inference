It is a programming paradigm that uses objects and their interactions to design applications and computer programs. Object-oriented programming has several advantages over other programming paradigms, such as procedural programming. One of the main advantages of object-oriented programming is that it allows for the creation of reusable code. This means that once a piece of code has been written, it can be used again and again in different programs without having to be rewritten. This can save a lot of time and effort, especially in large projects. Another advantage of object-oriented programming is that it allows for the creation of modular code. This means that code can be broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces that can be easily understood and maintained. This can make code easier to debug and fix if something goes wrong. Object-oriented programming also allows for the creation of objects that can be used to represent real-world'}]}

The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In other words, if you have a right triangle with sides a and b and hypotenuse c, then c^2 = a^2 + b^2. To calculate the distance between two points, you need to know the coordinates of the two points. The coordinates of a point are its x-coordinate and y-coordinate.
