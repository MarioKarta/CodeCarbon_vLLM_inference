They are used in a variety of applications, such as image and video generation, text generation, and speech synthesis. Generative models are particularly useful for tasks that are difficult to learn from labeled data, such as image classification.\nGenerative models are typically divided into two types: discriminative and generative. Discriminative models are used to learn a mapping from the input data to the output labels. Generative models, on the other hand, are used to learn a joint probability distribution over the input and output data. This distribution can then bediscriminatively used to generate new data.\nGenerative models are typically trained using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).
