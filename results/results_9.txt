One possible solution to air pollution is to reduce the amount of pollution that is produced in the first place. This can be done in part by using more efficient and cleaner forms of energy, such as solar and wind power. Additionally, it is important to reduce the amount of pollution that is produced by our transportation systems. This can be done by encouraging more people to use public transportation, carpooling, and walking or riding a bike.\nAnother important step in the fight against air pollution is to reduce the amount of pollution that is already in the air. This can be done in part by using pollution-control technologies in our power plants and factories. Additionally, it is important to reduce the amount of pollution that is produced by our homes and businesses. This can be done by using more energy-efficient appliances and by using non-polluting cleaning supplies'}]}
