Output Tokens: 200
Response: {'choices': [{'text': '\nThe learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls the size of the steps taken during the optimization process. It determines how far to move in the negative gradient direction with each update. A large learning rate can result in faster convergence, but can also result in missing the optimal solution. A small learning rate, on the other hand, results in slower convergence, but can result in better performance.\nWhat is the difference between overfitting and underfitting in machine learning?\nOverfitting is a type of error that occurs when a machine learning model is too complex and ends up performing poorly on new, unseen data. This is because the model has trouble generalizing and ends up overfitting to the training data.\nUnderfitting, on the other hand, is when the model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data. This hurts the model’s performance on both the training and test data.\nHow do you handle imbalanced datasets in machine learning?\nImbalanced datasets'}]}
