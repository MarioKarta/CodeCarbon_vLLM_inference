Response: {'choices': [{'text': ' What is the significance of this co-efficient in the context of income distribution?\nThe Gini coefficient is a measure of statistical dispersion intended to represent the income or wealth distribution of a nation\'s residents, and is the most commonly used measure of inequality. It was developed by the Italian statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini and published in his 1912 paper "Variability and Mutability" (Italian: Variabilità e mutabilità). It measures the inequality among values of a frequency distribution (for example levels of income). A Gini coefficient of zero expresses perfect equality, where all values are the same (for example, where everyone has the same income). A Gini coefficient of one (or 100%) expresses maximal inequality among values (e.g., for a large number of people where only one person has all the income or consumption and all others have none, the Gini coefficient will be nearly one). For larger groups, values close to one are very unusual.'}]}

Other transactions that want to access the same data item must wait until the lock is released.\nOptimistic concurrency control is a mechanism that assumes that multiple transactions can access the same data item at the same time.

They can produce many offspring with different traits, and it can be difficult to control which traits are passed on to the offspring.\nToday, genetic engineering is often used to improve the traits of plants.
