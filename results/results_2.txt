Output Tokens: 200
Response: {'choices': [{'text': ' A capacitor is a device that stores electrical energy in an electric field. It consists of two conductors separated by a dielectric (insulator). When a potential difference is applied across the conductors, electrons are forced away from the positive conductor and towards the negative conductor. This creates an electric field between the conductors. The strength of the electric field is proportional to the potential difference applied across the conductors. The amount of energy stored in the capacitor is proportional to the square of the potential difference. The capacitance of a capacitor is defined as the ratio of the charge stored on each conductor to the potential difference applied across them. The unit of capacitance is the farad (F), which is equal to one coulomb per volt. Capacitors are used in many electronic devices, such as radios, televisions, and computers.

In this article, we will discuss some of the most commonly used metrics for evaluating fraud detection models.\nThe first metric we will discuss is the accuracy of the model. Accuracy is the proportion of correct predictions made by the model, and it is calculated as the number of true positives (TP) plus the number of true negatives (TN) divided by the total number of observations. A high accuracy indicates that the model is able to accurately classify both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.\nAnother important metric is the precision of the model.
