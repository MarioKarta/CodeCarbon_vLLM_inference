While AI no doubt has brought many benefits, it is important to consider the ethical implications of its use.\nOne issue related to the ethics of using AI is the potential for job loss. As AI systems become more advanced, they are replacing many routine, manual labor jobs. This can lead to job losses as entire industries decline or see their work displaced by AI. This can be a major issue, as entire communities can see their economic prospects suffer due to the loss of these jobs.\nAnother issue is the potential for bias built into AI systems.
