Response: {'choices': [{'text': "\n1 Answer | Add Yours\nThe impact of climate change on the world's oceans is multi-faceted.\nFirst, the oceans absorb a great deal of the carbon dioxide that is released into the atmosphere. This causes the oceans to become more acidic. This is a problem for shelled creatures like clams and oysters.\nSecond, the warming of the oceans is causing the thermohaline circulation to slow down. This is the current that carries warm surface water to the poles and cold deep water to the equator. This current is a major regulator of the Earth's climate. If it slows down, the Earth will warm at a faster rate.\nFinally, the rise in sea level that is a result of global warming is having a major impact on the world's coastlines. This is leading to the flooding and destruction of many coastal cities.\nWe’ve answered 318,915 questions. We can answer yours, too.Ask a question"}]}

Response: {'choices': [{'text': "\nWeather changes over time because of the movement of air masses. Air masses are large masses of air that move from one place to another. Air masses are made up of air molecules that are all the same temperature and water vapor content. When air masses move, they can pick up water vapor from the air and from the Earth's surface. This water vapor condenses to form clouds, which can then produce rain or snow.\nThe movement of air masses is influenced by the Earth's rotation and the Earth's rotation causes the air to swirl around the Earth's axis. This causes the air to rise and cool as it moves up and over the Earth's surface. As the air cools, it can no longer hold as much water vapor, so the water vapor condenses to form clouds.\nThe movement of air masses is also influenced by the Earth's rotation and the Earth's rotation causes the air to swirl around the Earth's axis.
