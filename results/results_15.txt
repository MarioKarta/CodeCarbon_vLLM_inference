Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class. Inheritance is the process of inheriting properties and methods from a parent class, allowing for code reuse and extension. Polymorphism is the ability of a message to be sent to an object in such a way that it is received and handled in a way that is appropriate to the object's class.\nObject-oriented programming is an important paradigm for developing large-scale, maintainable, and scalable software systems.

This can have a major impact on crop yields and food security.\n- Changes in the timing of key events: Warmer temperatures are also leading to earlier bud break and flowering, which can leave crops more vulnerable to late-season frosts and other weather events.\n- Changes in'}]}
