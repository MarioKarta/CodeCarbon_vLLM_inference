Every display form has its own advantages and in different situations particular form is more convenient than another. For example usage of scientific notation when working with big numbers is recommended due to easier reading and comprehension. Usage of fractions is recommended when more precision is needed.\nIf we want to calculate how many Liters are 250 Milliliters we have to multiply 250 by 1 and divide the product by 1000.

In this article, we will explore how AI can be used to generate creative outputs, as well as the benefits and limitations of using AI for creative tasks.\nOne of the most promising applications of AI in the creative field is the use of generative models. These models are trained on large datasets of existing creative content, such as images, music, or text, and can then generate new content that is similar to the training data. For example, a generative model trained on a dataset of paintings could generate new paintings that are stylistically similar to the training data, but with unique and original compositions.\nAnother application of AI in the creative field is the use of natural language processing ('}]}
