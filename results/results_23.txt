Response: {'choices': [{'text': ' What are the advantages and disadvantages of 3D printing?\n3D printing is a process of making three dimensional solid objects from a digital file. The creation of a 3D printed object is achieved using additive processes. In an additive process an object is created by laying down successive layers of material until the entire object is created. Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly sliced horizontal cross-section of the eventual object. 3D printing is also referred to as additive manufacturing (AM) or solid freeform fabrication (SFF). 3D printing is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing which is cutting out / hollowing out a piece of metal or plastic with for example a milling machine. 3D printing enables you to produce complex shapes using less material than traditional manufacturing methods. It has a large range of applications, which include building and construction, food, footwear, aerospace, automotive, dental and medical industries. 3D printing is used in both prototyping and final manufacturing of a'}]}
