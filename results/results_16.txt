The seed does not actively grow or develop in any way. The seed is simply waiting for the right conditions to come before it can germinate.\nThe active growth stage is when the seed begins to germinate. The radicle (shoot tip) pushes through the seed coat and the plumule ( shoot tip ) begins to grow. The plumule will then elongate and form leaves.\nThe reproductive stage is when the seed matures and is ready to be dispersed. The seed will dry out and harden, making it more buoyant and able to float in water. The seed will then be dispersed by wind, water, or animals.\nWhat are the 4 stages of seed germination?\n'}]}
