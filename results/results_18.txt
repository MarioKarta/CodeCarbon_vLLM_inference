It works by scanning files and programs for known viruses and other types of malware, and then removing or quarantining any infected files. Antivirus software can also provide real-time protection by monitoring incoming and outgoing network traffic for suspicious activity.\nThere are several different types of antivirus software available, including:\n1. Signature-based antivirus: This type of antivirus software uses a database of known virus signatures to detect and remove malware. It is effective at detecting known viruses, but may not be able to detect new or unknown viruses.\n2. Heuristic-based antivirus: This type of antivirus software uses algorithms to analyze the behavior of files and programs to detect malware. It is more effective at detecting new or unknown viruses, but may generate more false positives.\n3.
